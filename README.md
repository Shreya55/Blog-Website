# Bloggin-Bits
Hello everyone, this is a Django blog-application which firstly asks it's users to authenticate the system by doing a registration. Once the user is registered, he can login
to the app and then create a new post, see the posts created by other users, and even filter their posts based on the author. This application has also made use of social media
authentication for login where a user can login via his google, facebook, linkedin or github accounts. It also has a password recovery option incase the user forgets his
password.

<h4>In order to run the application, follow the commands in a terminal - </h4>
1) Change the directory to the main app (here blog) ie. cd blog (windows).
2) Then type the command- python manage.py runserver .
This will open the application in localhost, domain 8000. Make sure to change the url as "localhost:8000" instead of "http://127.0.0.1:8000/".
